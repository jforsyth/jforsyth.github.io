      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because pervasive computing systems deal intimately with human needs and interactions, they must be envisioned and developed by interdisciplinary teams that not only understand the technological challenges, but the human ones as well. Crucial to this design process is ensuring these teams are effective and well-functioning. Specifically, it is important that all participants understand the abilities of team members from other disciplines. In earlier work I examined how prototyping exercises helped clarify project goals and establish a disciplinary rapport within teams. More recently I have studied the motivations of capstone design teams. In particular, we have compared the attitudes and experiences of students working on traditional, single discipline projects, such as design of off-road and race cars, as compared to students working in a more interdisciplinary setting designing a smart greenhouse for a local elementary school and assistive technologies for persons with mental and physical disabilities. Looking at these two populations, we found that students who participated in the more interdisciplinary and service-oriented projects felt more personal satisfaction in their engineering work than their peers on the single discipline projects.&lt;/p&gt;
