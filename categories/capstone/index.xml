      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Nicole Hesson (Education) and I have received a Great to Greater Grant from the Office of the President to engage engineering and education students in community-based service projects. Grant funds will go towards two new capstone projects: an automated greenhouse at Goode School in York City, and assistive technologies for employees with mental and physical difficulties at Shadowfax Corp. Education students will support the project by creating custom science curriculum for teachers at Goode to support the greenhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
