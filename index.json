While there is not a single widely accepted definition of convergence, there are some general aspects noted by the NSF including: socially relevant, multidisciplinary, complex, and not being adequately addressed by current methods and practices. Convergent problems require existing disciplines to collaborate to create new knowledge, skills, and approaches in order to be appropriately addressed. We believe that there are aspects of the entrepreneurial mindset and the learning of it that can support the development of knowledge, skills, and attitudes to approach convergent problems. This is relevant because most work on convergent problems happens at the graduate level and beyond and our interest is to create experiences for undergraduates that prepare them to embark on this work after graduation. \r\n\r\nThis study maps entrepreneurial mindset learning (EML) onto a framework based on prior work on convergence to identify the aspects of EML that directly support convergence work or preparation for convergence work. The existing dataset of KEEN cards is used as a proxy for existing work in this space, as well. \r\n\r\nIf existing work in EML can address some or all of the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed for convergent problem solving then engineering educators have a set of tools and practices that can contribute towards creating engineers who are better prepared to work on the hard problems of tomorrow.\r\n","tags":null,"title":"Addressing Convergent Problems with Entrepreneurially-Minded Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jenna E.

One critically important\r\nelement of these interactions is user trust, as it can predict\r\nautomated systems' safe and effective use. Past research has\r\nevaluated individuals' trust in automation through a host of\r\ndifferent assessment techniques such as self-report,\r\nphysiological, and behavioral measures. However, to date, there\r\nhas been little evaluation of the convergence across these\r\nmeasures in a real-world environment. Convergence across\r\nmeasures is a useful tool in understanding the mechanisms by\r\nwhich a cognitive construct is impacted and providing greater\r\nconfidence that any single measure is evaluating what it\r\npurports to measure. \r\n\r\nThe present study used an autonomous\r\ngolf cart that drove participants to different locations around\r\nthe campus of James Madison University while a camera\r\nrecorded them. In addition, participants were given the AICPR\r\nand TOAST to evaluate their complacency potential and\r\ntrust, respectively. Researchers coded videos for\r\nverification/checking behaviors (i.e., participants looked at or\r\ninteracted with the GUI used to control the cart) and nervous\r\nbehaviors (i.e., bracing, fidgeting, etc.). Additionally,\r\nenvironmental 'obstacles' such as pedestrians, food-delivery\r\nrobots, and construction were also coded for by watching a\r\nfront-facing camera. Results indicate a disconnect between the\r\nself-report and behavioral measures evaluating trust. However,\r\nthere was a relationship between the coded nervous behaviors\r\nand verification behaviors and a relationship between those and\r\nthe presence of obstacles. \r\n\r\nThis lack of convergence across\r\nmeasures indicates a need for future research to understand\r\nwhether this non-convergence represents shortcomings with the\r\nmeasures themselves, the existing definition of trust as a\r\nconstruct, or perhaps indicates that there is a nuance that can\r\nbe afforded by some measures over another.\r\n","tags":null,"title":"Convergence Across Behavioral and Self-report Measures Evaluating Individuals' Trust in an Autonomous Golf Cart","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["JMU","Undergraduate Research"],"content":"There are many new items to report for the Wearable Computer Research group this fall semester!\nNew Undergraduate Researchers With the graduation of Sophia Cronin (Microsoft) and Jonathan Li (Dev Technology Group) we are in need of new undergraduate researchers.

Providing a variety of both optional and required learning experiences can\r\ncreate an ecosystem of support by connecting students to their peers, near-peers, academic\r\nadvisors, and engineering faculty. Ultimately, a nurturing ecosystem might shift student success\r\nby cultivating an understanding of engineering expectations and opportunities (i.e., sensemaking),\r\ngaining an emerging awareness of professional self and program culture (i.e., identity\r\nformation), and fostering connections to their engineering institution (i.e., belonging). Another\r\nreason to invest in these efforts is to demonstrate a commitment to student well-being, in other\r\nwords that the program “walks the talk” as a place concerned with undergraduate professional\r\ndevelopment through a supportive community.

This trend, alongside the proliferation of new wearable technologies, has expanded the possibilities for both professional and amateur athletes to instrument themselves and collect meaningful data. The reactive strength index (RSI) can be used to communicate this kind of data by presenting a person's ability for rapid movement. A user study was conducted in which young adults of amateur athletic status performed a jumping exercise to assess the feasibility of using a commercial off-the-shelf inertial measurement unit (IMU) to measure this metric compared to the usual method of using a force plate.

During Physical Rehabilitation, a patient undergoes treatment including instructions to perform exercises at home; however, patients often forget to or incorrectly perform the exercises thereby hindering recovery.\r\nThe proposed research seeks to use wearable computing technology to create a system that detects exercise performance, sends collected data to the physician, and provides immediate feedback to the patient. The team is exploring how they can provide effective client feedback to increase patient performance and self efficiency. Currently, the team is exploring light and haptic feedback which have shown high success rates in similar settings. Considering haptic feedback, the team has implemented vibration motors to send “push” signals that mimic the guidance of a physical therapist pushing patient motions into correct positioning. Considering visual feedback, the team implemented a circular arrangement of lights that guide the patient in the direction associated with where on the circle the light is illuminated.\r\nTo test ideas, we have conducted pilot studies where users performed simple predetermined exercises while receiving visual or haptic feedback from prototypes. Next, we plan to conduct a study where we can test a prototype combining visual and haptic feedback. Ultimately, a final product would consist of a wearable device that can read a patient’s data to provide immediate feedback to the patient and summarized feedback to the physician. \r\n","tags":null,"title":"Student Research Short: Wearable Computing for Physical Rehabilitation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["JMU","Undergraduate Research","Wearable Computing"],"content":"Despite the pandemic, Spring 2021 has been a productive time for the undergraduate researchers in the Wearable Computing Lab.\nStephen Mitchell presents his work at IEEE SouthEast Conference\nStephen Mitchell has presented his latest work at IEEE SouthEast Conference.

Those sudden shifts yielded ill-prepared remote learning experiences – dubbed pandemic teaching – that contributed to a growing fear of a drastic reduction in student enrollment in the forthcoming 2020-2021 academic year if the quality of remote engagement did not substantially improve. Institutions worldwide rapidly pivoted and sought to explore new means of effectively engaging their student populations, including incoming students, to shore up retention and matriculation in the face of a new and persisting remote learning environment. The authors of this study created a new virtual summer bridge program, named 24for24, to shore up their institution’s engagement with its students. 24for24 was targeted at the incoming class of 2024 engineering majors at a primarily undergraduate institution in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The summer bridge program was intentionally designed to generate excitement for the engineering major and to promote early community-building, which defines our paper’s two objectives, as a means of shoring up matriculation and provide the authors a metaphorical sandbox to explore online pedagogical practices emphasizing student engagement. The quality of the program’s two objectives were assessed using aggregated survey results and through qualitative observations of the matriculated cohort at the start of the 2020-2021 academic year. The authors found no measurable change in excitement for the major, yet the authors found that the summer bridge program fostered a small community made up of about 30 students who actively participated throughout the 8-week long program and continued to engage intimately with each other in the first-year engineering course at the start of the new academic year. The authors discuss perceived benefits and shortcomings of the program and speculate on means of strengthening it in a post-COVID-19 era where the threat of reduced student enrollment is ever-present due to demographic changes in the United States. The authors’ inaugural execution of 24for24 revealed that there is value in engaging with students in a virtual summer bridge program remotely as a cost-efficient means of fostering enthusiasm for engineering studies, fostering a sense of belonging through community-building, and priming student mindset for success.","tags":null,"title":"24for24: A Virtual Summer Bridge Program in Multiple 24-Minute Sessions for the Collegiate Class of 2024","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew James","Homero Murzi","Jason Forsyth","Lilianny Virguez","Pamela L.

The module engages the students in a guided design process using a custom robotic platform, the Ebot, that students incrementally build and enhance each week. Initially, students build an Ebot that they can manually drive forward and backward. By the end of the module, students create an autonomous line following robot. Throughout the process, students are asked to reflect upon how they could improve upon the previous week’s design. As part of this process students are introduced to various electrical/electronic devices, such as a digital multimeter, a DC power supply, SPST and SPDT switches, a phototransistor, DC motors and a microcontroller. However, the primary goals of the module are to introduce students to aspects of electrical and computer engineering and engineering methodology related to design, and to establish a sense of affiliation and connection between the students, the faculty and the engineering school.\r\n\r\nEnrollment in each module is capped at 18 students so that each student can receive significant individual attention and support from the faculty. Each faculty member actively fosters supportive relationships with and between the students and encourages self-confidence through the guided team-based activities. At the conclusion of the most recent offering, students were surveyed. The majority of students surveyed viewed the ECE module favorably: 89% agreed that they had learned a great deal in the ECE module; 78% agreed that the module provided them with an understanding of the electric and computer engineering fields; 91% agreed that the module was fun. The course addresses ABET student outcomes 2, 3, and 5. These outcomes focus on engineering design, communication, and teamwork, respectively.","tags":null,"title":"A Seven-week Module to Introduce Electrical and Computer Engineering to Freshmen Engineering Students","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["ASEE"],"content":"I am co-author on two papers this year at ASEE.

Often patients undergoing physical therapy are prescribed a set of stretches and exercises to strengthen an injured muscle group. While outside of the doctor’s office, the physical therapist cannot observe if the activities are being performed correctly or if at all. Wearable computing solutions have been developed that will allow human activities to be recognized. However, current approaches are limited to specific arm and leg motions and not the broader set of activities that would be required in a general tool usable by medical practitioners. The project would leverage existing machine learning and human-computer interaction techniques to develop a custom wearable computing system tailored to rehabilitation exercises of a particular patient. This system would create positive patient outcomes by providing feedback to the patient and the physical therapist about the quantity and quality of therapy activities performed.\nPublications from this work:\n Megan Caulfield, Jason Forsyth \u0026ldquo;Student Research Short: Wearable Computing for Physical Rehabilitation\u0026rdquo;, accepted for presentation at 2022 ACM Capital Region Celebration of Women in Computing (CAPWIC) (refereed as abstract)\n Sophia Cronin, Tyler Webster, Jason Forsyth “Student Research Short: Wearable Computing for Physical Rehabilitation”, Presentation at 2021 ACM Capital Region Celebration of Women in Computing (CAPWIC) (refereed as abstract) link\n Sanarea Ali, “Wearable Computing for Physical Rehabilitation”, at the 2019 ACM Capital Region Celebration of Women in Computing Conference (CAPWIC), March 23rd, 2019 link\n  Funding for the work:\n JMU CISE Faculty Development Grant: J.

Crucial to this design process is ensuring these teams are effective and well-functioning. Specifically, it is important that all participants understand the abilities of team members from other disciplines. In earlier work I examined how prototyping exercises helped clarify project goals and establish a disciplinary rapport within teams. More recently I have studied the motivations of capstone design teams. In particular, we have compared the attitudes and experiences of students working on traditional, single discipline projects, such as design of off-road and race cars, as compared to students working in a more interdisciplinary setting designing a smart greenhouse for a local elementary school and assistive technologies for persons with mental and physical disabilities. Looking at these two populations, we found that students who participated in the more interdisciplinary and service-oriented projects felt more personal satisfaction in their engineering work than their peers on the single discipline projects.\nPublications from this work:\nKala Meah, Jason Forsyth, James Moscola, “A Smart Sensor Network for an Automated Urban Greenhouse”, 2019 International Conference on Robotics, Electrical and Signal Progressing Techniques (ICREST), Dhaka, Bangladesh, January 10-12, 2019 link\nJason Forsyth, Mark Budnik, Randi Shedlosky, Jeff Will, “Effects of Service-Learning Projects on Capstone Student Motivation”, Proceedings of the American Society of Engineering Education Annual Conference – Multidisciplinary Engineering Division, Salt Lake City, Utah, June 24-27, 2018 link\nJason Forsyth, Nicole Hesson, “Benefits and Challenges Transitioning to Community Service Multidisciplinary Capstone Projects”, Proceedings of the American Society of Engineering Education Annual Conference – Multidisciplinary Engineering Division, Columbus, Ohio, June 25-28, 2017 link\nFunding for the work:\nJason Forsyth, Nicole Hesson, “Developing an Automated Greenhouse at Alexander D.

While providing significant benefits, challenges also exist in managing relationships with external clients, finding administrative support for these experiences, and engaging students in more open-ended projects.\r\n\r\nRecognizing these benefits, new capstone projects have been introduced at our mid-sized mid- Atlantic college over the last two years that focus on community outreach and service. These projects include a community bike rental station, an automated greenhouse for a K-8 school, and assistive technologies for employees with disabilities. These new projects exist along with “traditional” competition-based capstone projects such as Formula FSAE.\r\n\r\nGiven these two classes of multidisciplinary capstone projects, we examine the experiences of the students, faculty, and community partners during the transition to new service-learning capstone projects. Specifically, we report on interviews conducted: (1) with faculty to understand their administrative and instructional challenges in adding service-based capstone projects, (2) with community-partners and their perceptions of working with the college, and (3) with students to understand the differences in student experience and between traditional competition and new capstone projects.

By embedding computation, sensing, and networking into our daily environments, new computing systems can be developed that become helpful, supportive, and invisible elements of our lives. This tight proximity between the human and computational worlds poses challenges for the design of these systems - what disciplines should be involved in their design and what tools and processes should they follow? We address these issues by advocating for interdisciplinary design of pervasive computing systems. Based upon our experiences teaching courses in interactive architecture, product design, physical computing and through surveys of existing literature, we examine the challenges faced by interdisciplinary teams when developing pervasive computing systems. We find that teams lack accessible prototyping tools to express their design ideas across domains. To address this issue we propose a new software-based design tool called electronic storyboards. \r\n\r\nWe implement electronic storyboards by developing a domain-specific modeling language in the Eclipse Graphical Editor Framework. The key insight of electronic storyboards is to balance the tension between the ambiguity in drawn storyboards and the requirements of implementing computing systems. We implement a set of user-applied tags, perform layout analysis on the storyboard, and utilize natural language processing to extract behavioral information from the storyboard in the form of a timed automaton. This behavioral information is then transformed into design artifacts such as state charts, textual descriptions, and source code. \r\n\r\nTo evaluate the potential impact of electronic storyboards on interdisciplinary design teams we develop of user study based around ``boundary objects''. These objects are frequently used within computer-supported collaborative work to examine how objects mediate interactions between individuals. Teams of computing and non-computing participants were asked to storyboard pervasive computing systems and their storyboards were evaluated using a prototype electronic storyboarding tool. The study examines how teams use traditional storyboarding, tagging, tool queries, and generated artifacts to express design ideas and iterate upon their designs. From this study we develop new recommendations for future tools in architecture and fashion design based upon electronic storyboarding principles. \r\nOverall, this study contributes to the expanding knowledge base of pervasive computing design tools. As an emerging discipline, standardized tools and platforms have yet to be developed. Electronic storyboards offer a solution to describe pervasive computing systems across application domains and in a manner accessible to multiple disciplines.","tags":null,"title":"Exploring Electronic Storyboards as Interdisciplinary Design Tools for Pervasive Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Interdisciplinary design tools facilitate collaboration between engineering and design practitioners to ensure that pervasive products and services are aesthetically pleasing and technologically feasible. From our research with interdisciplinary teams, we found that a shared vocabulary and understanding of design constraints is critical for effective interdisciplinary collaboration. This requires prototyping tools to be accessible across disciplines but sufficiently powerful to develop a working system. Using our technique of electronic storyboards, design teams can electronically “sketch” how a pervasive system should behave and automatically synthesize behavioral descriptions of that system as source code, textual descriptions, and state charts. Descriptions are generated by analyzing storyboard layout, user-applied annotations, and natural language processing of text in the storyboard. During synthesis the electronic storyboard will query the design team to resolve missing or ambiguous information.\nThe descriptions produced by the electronic storyboard, and the tool queries during synthesis, serve as a reflection point for teams to understand if they have properly described their prototype. Storyboard synthesis is quick, taking less than one minute, and enables teams to focus on what a device “should” do, rather than how it is implemented. In a time constrained environment, rapid prototyping tools like electronic storyboards can facilitate better design outcomes by evaluating more prototypes over time. Initial results show this tool is usable by interdisciplinary teams, helps teams evaluate their design, and aids participants in understanding computational properties of the storyboarded systems.\nPublications from this work:\nJason Forsyth, Tom Martin, “Extracting Behavioral Information from Electronic Storyboards”, Proceedings of the 6th ACM SIGCHI Symposium on Engineering Interactive Computer Systems, Rome, Italy, June 17-20, 2014 (18% acceptance rate) link\nJason Forsyth, Tom Martin, “Tools for Interdisciplinary Design of Pervasive Computing”,International Journal of Pervasive Computing and Communications, vol. 8, no. 2, pp. 112-132, June 2012 (Invited Survey) link\nJason Forsyth, “Using Electronic Storyboards to Support Interdisciplinary Design of Pervasive Computing Systems”, Poster Presentation for the Sixth Annual Ph.D. Forum on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom), San Diego, March 20th, 2013\nEd Dorsa, Eloise Coupey, Tom Martin, Lisa McNair, Jason Forsyth, Sophie Kim, “Design Thinking Meets Computational Thinking – An Interdisciplinary Exercise in Developing Smart Product”, Industrial Design Society of America Education Symposium, August 2012 link\nFunding for the work: Tom Martin (PI), Jason Forsyth, Christian James, “Storycoding I-Corps Team”, National Science Foundation.

It’s the basis for some of the most widely recognized and respected graduate programs around – Stanford’s d.school being perhaps the most heralded - and many undergraduate programs strive to provide this kind of opportunity at least once during their students’ education.\r\nCollaborative, interdisciplinary education prepares students for the professional product development environment that they will be entering after graduation; an environment in which team members are expected to contribute creatively across disciplines, to work with people whose experience and methodology are markedly different than their own to identify opportunities for new products and systems.\r\nOften at an undergraduate level it is the Industrial Design program that advocates for and initiates these collaborations, usually with the Engineering and Business departments. Hence the curricular issues addressed and initial directions taken in interdisciplinary projects tend to have an Industrial Design bias.\r\nBut product development is a rapidly changing field; user needs and product capabilities are continually shifting even as we attempt to define them. Nowhere is this more evident than in the next generation of pervasive computing products and environments, where the very nature of the interaction is determined computationally. This new set of products, systems, and environments is driven by \"smart\" materials - computationally malleable materials1 - that evolve throughout their life cycle, requiring design, engineering and manufacturing processes that are significantly different and more complex than current processes. Product development teams are entering a world where the look, feel and sound of an object will be dynamically determined by computation rather than by mechanics, and with which, at this time, most design students have little or no experience.","tags":null,"title":"Design Thinking Meets Computational Thinking – An Interdisciplinary Exercise in Developing Smart Product","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jason Forsyth","Tom Martin","Deborah Young-Corbett","Ed Dorsa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1341100800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1341100800,"objectID":"2224de1574ee5ffc80f281e27dcdc3fb","permalink":"http://jasonforsyth.net/publication/tase-journal/","publishdate":"2012-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tase-journal/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a feasibility study of a wearable computing system to protect construction workers from carbon monoxide poisoning.

In particular, this study sought to understand the impact of motion artifacts caused by the worker's activities and to determine if those activities would prevent the blood gas sensor from detecting the onset of carbon monoxide poisoning. This feasibility study was conducted using a blood oxygen sensor rather than a blood carbon monoxide sensor for several reasons. First, blood gas sensors that measure blood carbon monoxide are not readily available in suitable physical form factors. Second, sensors for blood oxygen and blood carbon monoxide operate on the same physical principles and thus will be affected in the same way by worker motions. Finally, using a blood oxygen sensor allowed the study to be conducted without exposing the human subjects to carbon monoxide. A user study was conducted to determine the distribution of motion artifacts that would be created during a typical work day. By comparing that distribution to a worst-case estimate of time to impairment, the probability that helmet will adequately monitor the worker can be established. The results of the study show that the helmet will provide a measurement capable of warning the user of on setting carbon monoxide poisoning with a probability greater than 99%.","tags":null,"title":"Wearable Pulse Oximetry in Construction Environments","type":"publication"}]
