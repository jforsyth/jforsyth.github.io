The module engages the students in a guided design process using a custom robotic platform, the Ebot, that students incrementally build and enhance each week. Initially, students build an Ebot that they can manually drive forward and backward. By the end of the module, students create an autonomous line following robot. Throughout the process, students are asked to reflect upon how they could improve upon the previous week’s design. As part of this process students are introduced to various electrical/electronic devices, such as a digital multimeter, a DC power supply, SPST and SPDT switches, a phototransistor, DC motors and a microcontroller. However, the primary goals of the module are to introduce students to aspects of electrical and computer engineering and engineering methodology related to design, and to establish a sense of affiliation and connection between the students, the faculty and the engineering school.\n\nEnrollment in each module is capped at 18 students so that each student can receive significant individual attention and support from the faculty. Each faculty member actively fosters supportive relationships with and between the students and encourages self-confidence through the guided team-based activities. At the conclusion of the most recent offering, students were surveyed. The majority of students surveyed viewed the ECE module favorably: 89% agreed that they had learned a great deal in the ECE module; 78% agreed that the module provided them with an understanding of the electric and computer engineering fields; 91% agreed that the module was fun. The course addresses ABET student outcomes 2, 3, and 5. These outcomes focus on engineering design, communication, and teamwork, respectively.","tags":null,"title":"A Seven-week Module to Introduce Electrical and Computer Engineering to Freshmen Engineering Students","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["ASEE"],"content":"I am co-author on two papers this year at ASEE.

Elements of service-learning have been incorporated across disciplines into traditional classes as well as capstone experiences. While providing significant benefits, challenges also exist in managing relationships with external clients, finding administrative support for these experiences, and engaging students in more open-ended projects.\n\nRecognizing these benefits, new capstone projects have been introduced at our mid-sized mid- Atlantic college over the last two years that focus on community outreach and service. These projects include a community bike rental station, an automated greenhouse for a K-8 school, and assistive technologies for employees with disabilities. These new projects exist along with “traditional” competition-based capstone projects such as Formula FSAE.\n\nGiven these two classes of multidisciplinary capstone projects, we examine the experiences of the students, faculty, and community partners during the transition to new service-learning capstone projects. Specifically, we report on interviews conducted: (1) with faculty to understand their administrative and instructional challenges in adding service-based capstone projects, (2) with community-partners and their perceptions of working with the college, and (3) with students to understand the differences in student experience and between traditional competition and new capstone projects. We believe that our experiences can provide a guide for other institutions to manage the transition to service-based capstone projects in their curriculum.","tags":null,"title":"Benefits and Challenges of Transitioning to Community Service Multidisciplinary Capstone Projects","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stephen Wilkerson","Jason Forsyth","Christopher Korpela"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498348800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498348800,"objectID":"6fe7580fb8e2d349246aab836677cabe","permalink":"https://jforsyth.github.io/publication/ros-ycp/","publishdate":"2017-06-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ros-ycp/","section":"publication","summary":"Project-based learning (PBL) has been shown to be one of the more effective methods teachers use in engineering and computer science education.

From an interdisciplinary design class that brings together students from industrial design, computer engineering, and marketing, we present an evaluative analysis of three hands-on, discipline-specific exercises designed to remove disciplinary barriers and promote cross-disciplinary appreciation.\nWe examine the impact of these exercises through the theoretical lens of Boix-Mansilla’s construct of assessing interdisciplinarity, specifically focusing on purposefulnnes, disciplinary grounding, advancement through integration, and critical awareness. A coding system based on these criteria was expanded to include activities beyond writing and teaming processes. The resulting criteria was used to analyze transcripts of in-class team conversations and instructor facilitation. Results indicate that the interdisciplinary exercises achieved four outcomes: 1) the workshops encouraged disciplinary grounding for all the disciplines using domain knowledge from each participating discipline, 2) the workshops promoted team-level interdisciplinary integration, 3) the workshops helped students to reflect on their own choices and make more interdisciplinary decisions, and 4) the workshops provided integrative tools that led students to frame projects with interdisciplinary approaches.","tags":null,"title":"Interdisciplinary Pedagogy for Pervasive Computing Design Processes: An Evaluative Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Blake Sawyer","Jason Forsyth","Taylor O'Connor","Brennon Bortz","Teri Finn","Liesl Baum","Ico Bukvic","Benjamin Knapp","Dane Webster"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1362528000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1362528000,"objectID":"948d7591d3ad0f9d91df9d4c6af50905","permalink":"https://jforsyth.github.io/publication/sigcse/","publishdate":"2013-03-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sigcse/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents the planning, execution and results of a 5-day musical instrument MAKErs camp for K-12 students.

It’s the basis for some of the most widely recognized and respected graduate programs around – Stanford’s d.school being perhaps the most heralded - and many undergraduate programs strive to provide this kind of opportunity at least once during their students’ education.\nCollaborative, interdisciplinary education prepares students for the professional product development environment that they will be entering after graduation; an environment in which team members are expected to contribute creatively across disciplines, to work with people whose experience and methodology are markedly different than their own to identify opportunities for new products and systems.\nOften at an undergraduate level it is the Industrial Design program that advocates for and initiates these collaborations, usually with the Engineering and Business departments. Hence the curricular issues addressed and initial directions taken in interdisciplinary projects tend to have an Industrial Design bias.\nBut product development is a rapidly changing field; user needs and product capabilities are continually shifting even as we attempt to define them. Nowhere is this more evident than in the next generation of pervasive computing products and environments, where the very nature of the interaction is determined computationally. This new set of products, systems, and environments is driven by \"smart\" materials - computationally malleable materials1 - that evolve throughout their life cycle, requiring design, engineering and manufacturing processes that are significantly different and more complex than current processes. Product development teams are entering a world where the look, feel and sound of an object will be dynamically determined by computation rather than by mechanics, and with which, at this time, most design students have little or no experience.","tags":null,"title":"Design Thinking Meets Computational Thinking – An Interdisciplinary Exercise in Developing Smart Product","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jason Forsyth","Tom Martin","Deborah Young-Corbett","Ed Dorsa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1341100800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1341100800,"objectID":"2224de1574ee5ffc80f281e27dcdc3fb","permalink":"https://jforsyth.github.io/publication/tase-journal/","publishdate":"2012-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tase-journal/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a feasibility study of a wearable computing system to protect construction workers from carbon monoxide poisoning.
